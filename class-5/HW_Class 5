Lesson recap

    In JavaScript, what is a function and when might you want to create one?
    A JavaScript function is a set of statements created to perform a particular task(s). If you plan on exceuting the same 
    task multiple times, creating a function allows you to call the function rather than re-type the set of statements again.
    
    In CSS, what is the difference between a class and an id? 
    A CSS id  starts with a '#' sign and styles a single element with a unique id name. 
    A CSS class starts with a '.' sign and can be used to style multiple elements the same way. 
    
    In HTML, does the order of elements matter? Why? 
    For HTML, the order of the elements matter because the HTML elements are executed from top-to-bottom in discrete steps. 
    
    When might you need to use an array? How about an object? 
    An array is used when you want an ordered list and to access each value in the array by index number (i). 
    An object is used when order doesn't matter and to access each value in the object by name.
