Intro to interactivity
What are some strategies interactive map developers can use to ensure maps with a lot of interactions are not overwhelming?
By considering the UI/UX we want to employ for our map, we can use the following strategies to not overwhelm the map reader: 
-Map is designed for a specific audience who already has some technical knowledge
-Simple layout but allows for straightforward paths for users with a specific questions to dig deeper and find the answers
-Lets users take their time with the map rather than expressing the point of the map as quickly as possible. 
-Consider how audience would view map as in mobile vs. desktop
-Limit pan and zoom or predetermine where users can zoom, pan or fly-to
-Add info boxes, popups
-Add search box, geolocation button
-Allow for tilting or rotation of map

Why do we use the term “map user” instead of “map reader?” 
Map users is more appropriate because they are self-guided users of our map and based on the interactions we have added to the map, choose what they want to experience. 
Map readers were more appropriate for print cartography maps (static maps). 

Common types of interaction
What is geocoding and how might you add it to an interactive map?
Geocoding is the process of converting human-readable search terms into mappable coordinates (and sometimes other contextual information). 
It is very complex and usually never free because you would need an user account with a provider to have a working search box. 

Intro to events
What is an event?
An event is an object that has specific information about what just happened. 

Describe an example of how you could use an event listener with an interactive map.
The event listener waits for a specific item to occur, is activated when it does occur, and carries out specific actions in response. 
An event listener in an interactive map waits for the user to click someowhere on the map, and depending on the lat-long coordinates they clicked on, an infobox pops up
